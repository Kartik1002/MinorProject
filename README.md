# PrepEasy: Computer Science Roadmaps

A web application that consolidates exam preparation resources specifically for Computer Science students. The platform provides categorized links to high-quality YouTube videos, technical articles, and previous years' exam papers for various subjects. Users can access this content through an intuitive interface, allowing them to focus on studying without the hassle of searching for reliable resources. 

<h3>Why?</h3>
IT students often face challenges during their semester exams due to a lack of organized study resources. While there is a wealth of educational content available online, students frequently struggle to find relevant and quality material, such as YouTube videos, articles, and past exam papers. The absence of a centralized platform leads to wasted time and unfocused exam preparation.
